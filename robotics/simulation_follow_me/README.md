## 👋 Overview

The `Simulation Follow Me` sample is a AMR to detect, track, and follow a moving person in real time. It integrates sensor emulation and motion control to  follow human-following behavior in simulated environments.

| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| camera node          | Publishes camera frames rgb image data to a ROS topic in Gazebo |
| depth camera node    | Publishes camera frames depth image data to a ROS topic in Gazebo |
| Root base node       | Subscribes to control commands and coordinates motion with the AMR in Gazebo. |
| Follow me Tracker    | Subscribes camera info and run model to target detection on Device |
| Follow me Controller | Publishes movement execution /cmd_vel commands on Device     |

## ✨ Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **PREREQUISITES**: The following steps need to be run on **Qualcomm Ubuntu** and **ROS Jazzy**.<br>
> For Qualcomm Linux, please check out the [Qualcomm Intelligent Robotics Product SDK](https://docs.qualcomm.com/bundle/publicresource/topics/80-70018-265/introduction_1.html?vproduct=1601111740013072&version=1.4&facet=Qualcomm%20Intelligent%20Robotics%20Product%20(QIRP)%20SDK) documents to prepare  complete the device.

## 🚀 Usage

<details>
  <summary>Usage details</summary>

### On Device

- Please refer to the [follow me]([https://github.com/qualcomm-qrb-ros/qrb_ros_samples/blob/main/robotics/sample_followme/README.md) to launch follow me function on device

### On Host

- Please refer to the `Quick Start` of [QRB ROS Simulation](https://github.com/qualcomm-qrb-ros/qrb_ros_simulation) to launch `QRB Robot Base AMR` on host. Ensure that the device and the host are on the same local network and can communicate with each other via ROS communication.

- Sync and run sample project in Gazebo


```
#run samples in Gazebo
git clone https://github.com/qualcomm-qrb-ros/qrb_ros_samples.git

cd robotics/simulation_follow_me

ros2 launch qrb_ros_sim_gazebo gazebo_robot_base_mini.launch.py world_model:=warehouse_followme_path2  rgb_camera_config_file:=$(pwd)/followme_rgb_camera_params.yaml enable_laser:=false enable_imu:=false
```

## ❔ FAQs

<details>
<summary>Why only have two pre-set path in the sample?</summary><br>
This sample is intended to demonstrate our existing "follow-me" functionality and the simulation environment. Therefore, additional scenes are not configured. If needed, you can modify the world model file (for example: warehouse_followme_path2 in qrb ros simulation project) to change the character’s movement trajectory.
